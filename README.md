## Compilation and Execution of C Files

To compile and execute C files for different questions, follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - On Linux, use your preferred terminal emulator.

2. **Navigate to the Directory Containing the C Files:**
   - Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the directory where your C files are located. For example:
     ```
     cd path/to/your/c/files
     ```

3. **Compile the C File:**
   - Use a C compiler like `gcc` to compile your C file. Replace `filename.c` (for e.g., part1.c, part3.c, etc.) with the actual name of your C file and `output` with the desired name of the output executable.
     ```
     gcc filename.c -o output
     ```
  - For e.g.,
    ```
     gcc part1.c -o part1
     ```

4. **Execute the Compiled Program:**
   - After successful compilation, you can execute the program with super user priviledges using the following command:
     ```
     sudo ./output
     ```
   - Replace `output` with the actual name you provided in step 3.

5. **View the Output

##Note

1. Instructions specific to each file have been added in the pdf file for each of the questions/parts.
2. For part3.c file, if pcap.h header file is not installed, use the command ``` sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8-dev ``` to install the header file and then run the command ``` gcc -o part3 part3.c -lpcap ```.

## Part 4

Part-4 questions have been solved with screenshots attached in the pdf file.
